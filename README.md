- **Immutable Records** â€“ Ensures tamper-proof transaction history.  
- **Role-Based Access** â€“ Different roles (manufacturer, supplier, retailer, customer) with permissions.  
- **Smart Contract Automation** â€“ Automates order fulfillment and payments.  
- **Privacy & Security** â€“ Utilizes cryptographic hashing for sensitive data.  

### ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack  
- **Solidity** â€“ Smart contract development  
- **Hardhat** â€“ Development and testing framework  
- **Ethers.js** â€“ Blockchain interaction  
- **React.js / Next.js** â€“ Frontend (Optional)  (currently working)
- **IPFS / Arweave** â€“ Decentralized storage (if required)  (working on these two)
